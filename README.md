# cards-image-recognition
This repository contains software for image recognition of playing cards. The software is sophisticated enough to recognize even cases when multiple cards are in one image and when cards are partially covering each other.

The repository is divided into two parts:
- android: this directory contains the Android app with support for card recognition using the phone's camera. Subsequently, it provides a way to calculate the optimal result of a deal (for playing Contract Bridge).
- python: this directory contains the program used to train the image recognition software.

Requirements:
OpenCV 3.1
Python 3
Android SDK
